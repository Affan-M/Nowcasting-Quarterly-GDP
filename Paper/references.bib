We design a bottom-up approach: forecasts for GDP components (from the output and the expenditure approaches) are inputs into the computation of probabilistic forecasts for GDP growth. For each GDP component considered, mixed-data-sampling regressions are applied to extract predictive content from monthly and quarterly indicators. We find that predictions from the nowcasting system are accurate, in particular when nowcasts are computed using monthly indicators 30 days before the GDP release. The system is also able to provide well-calibrated predictive intervals.},

It applies standard dynamic factor models (DFMs) and several machine learning (ML) algorithms to nowcast GDP growth across a heterogenous group of European economies during normal and crisis times. Most of our methods significantly outperform the AR(1) benchmark model. Our DFMs tend to perform better during normal times while many of the ML methods we used performed strongly at identifying turning points. Our approach is easily applicable to other countries, subject to data availability.},

  abstract = {Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been the catalyst to numerous advances in a variety of fields and disciplines in recent years. Their impact on economics, however, has been comparatively muted. One type of ANN, the long short-term memory network (LSTM), is particularly wellsuited to deal with economic time-series. Here, the architecture’s performance and characteristics are evaluated in comparison with the dynamic factor model (DFM), currently a popular choice in the field of economic nowcasting. LSTMs are found to produce superior results to DFMs in the nowcasting of three separate variables; global merchandise export values and volumes, and global services exports. Further advantages include their ability to handle large numbers of input features in a variety of time frequencies. A disadvantage is the inability to ascribe contributions of input features to model outputs, common to all ANNs. In order to facilitate continued applied research of the methodology by avoiding the need for any knowledge of deep-learning libraries, an accompanying Python library was developed using PyTorch: https://pypi.org/project/nowcast-lstm/.},

We look at whether a mixed data-frequency sampling (MIDAS) approach can improve forecasts of output growth. The MIDAS approach is compared to other ways of making use of monthly data to predict quarterly output growth. The MIDAS speci…cation used in the comparison employs a novel way of including an autoregressive term. We …nd that the use of monthly data on the current quarter leads to signi…cant improvement in forecasting current and next quarter output growth, and that MIDAS is an e¤ective way of exploiting monthly data compared to alternative methods. We also exploit the best method to use the monthly vintages of the indicators for real-time forecasting.},

  abstract = {Summary             Mixed data sampling (MIDAS) regressions allow us to estimate dynamic equations that explain a low frequency variable by high frequency variables and their lags. When the difference in sampling frequencies between the regressand and the regressors is large, distributed lag functions are typically employed to model dynamics avoiding parameter proliferation. In macroeconomic applications, however, differences in sampling frequencies are often small. In such a case, it might not be necessary to employ distributed lag functions. We discuss the pros and cons of unrestricted lag polynomials in MIDAS regressions. We derive unrestricted-MIDAS (U-MIDAS) regressions from linear high frequency models, discuss identification issues and show that their parameters can be estimated by ordinary least squares. In Monte Carlo experiments, we compare U-MIDAS with MIDAS with functional distributed lags estimated by non-linear least squares. We show that U-MIDAS performs better than MIDAS for small differences in sampling frequencies. However, with large differing sampling frequencies, distributed lag functions outperform unrestricted polynomials. The good performance of U-MIDAS for small differences in frequency is confirmed in empirical applications on nowcasting and short-term forecasting euro area and US gross domestic product growth by using monthly indicators.},

  abstract = {We examine whether machine learning algorithms can improve nowcasts of real GDP growth in New Zealand. We use a large real-time dataset of around 550 New Zealand and international macroeconomic indicators. We train a range of popular machine learning algorithms over an expanding window and replicate an actual nowcasting situation starting from 2009 Q1 and moving forward a quarter at a time through to 2018 Q1. We compare the predictive accuracy of these nowcasts with that of other benchmarks such as a simple autoregressive model, a factor model, a large Bayesian VAR and a suite of statistical models used at the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. We find that the machine learning algorithms outperform the statistical benchmarks. Moreover, combining the nowcasts of the machine learning models leads to further improvements in performance. The results indicate that there are gains in nowcasting accuracy from using machine learning methods.},

The aim of this survey is to describe the key theoretical results, applications, and empirical findings in the recent literature on DFMs. The article is organized as follows. The first issue at hand for the econometrician is to estimate the factors and to ascertain how many factors there are; these two topics are covered in Sections 2 and 3. Once one has reliable estimates of the factors, there are a number of things one can do with them beyond using them for forecasting, including using them as instrumental variables, estimating factor-augmented vector autoregressions, and estimating dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models; these applications are covered in Section 4. Section 5 discusses some extensions.},

Handling large and complex data sets was a challenge that macroeconomists engaged in real-time analysis faced long before “big data” became pervasive in other disciplines. We review how methods for tracking economic conditions using big data have evolved over time and explain how econometric techniques have advanced to mimic and automate the best practices of forecasters on trading desks, at central banks, and in other market-monitoring roles. We present in detail the methodology underlying the New York Fed Staff Nowcast, which employs these innovative techniques to produce early estimates of GDP growth, synthesizing a wide range of macroeconomic data as they become available.},

We have evaluated the performance of six popular ML algorithms, such as Random Forest, LASSO, Ridge, Elastic Net, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines, in doing real-time forecast on GDP growth from 2013:Q3 to 2019:Q4 period. We used the RMSE, MAD, and Pearson correlation coefficient as measurements of forecast accuracy. The results showed that the performance of all these models outperformed AR (1) benchmark. The individual model that showed the best performance is random forest. To gain more accurate forecast result, we run forecast combination using equal weighting and lasso regression. The best model was obtained from forecast combination using lasso regression with selected ML models, which are Random Forest, Ridge, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network.},

  abstract = {Macroeconomic analysis in Lebanon presents a distinct challenge. For example, long delays in the publication of GDP data mean that our analysis often relies on proxy variables, and resembles an extended version of the "nowcasting" challenge familiar to many central banks. Addressing this problem--and mindful of the pitfalls of extracting information from a large number of correlated proxies--we explore some recent techniques from the machine learning literature. We focus on two popular techniques (Elastic Net regression and Random Forests) and provide an estimation procedure that is intuitively familiar and well suited to the challenging features of Lebanon's data.--Abstract},
